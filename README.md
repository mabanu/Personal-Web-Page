# PERSONAL WEB SITE PROJECT

## Take a look of my website by click [HERE](https://mabanu.github.io/Personal-Web-Page/)

I come with the idea of make a website about me, showing my interest and try to tell my history.
I take the concept of the great and crazy guitar made by Eddie Van Halen, the Frankenstrat.

>The Frankenstrat was Van Halen's attempt to combine the sound of a classic Gibson guitar 
    with the physical attributes and tremolo bar functionality of a Fender Stratocaster.

Under this philosophy, I will try to combine the best and most interesting parts and visual striking components.
