# PERSONAL WEBSITE PROJECT

## Take a look at my website by click [HERE](https://mabanu.github.io/Personal-Web-Page/)

I came up with the idea of making a website showing my interests, hobbies, and trying to tell my history.

I take the concept of the great and crazy guitar made by Eddie Van Halen, the Frankenstrat.

>The Frankenstrat was Van Halen's attempt to combine the sound of a classic Gibson guitar
with the physical attributes and tremolo bar functionality of a Fender Stratocaster.

Under this philosophy, I will try to combine the best and most interesting parts and visually striking components,
into something crazy and awesome.

### Thanks.
